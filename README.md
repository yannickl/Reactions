**Reactions** is a fully customizable control to give people more ways to share their reaction in a quick and easy way.

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 9.0+
- Swift 4.2+

## Usage

### Reaction

 <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798235/19212812/1bc819f6-8d5a-11e6-81fc-555f02db2342.png" alt="Reaction" height="132px">

A `Reaction` object is a model defined with these properties:

- *id:* a unique identifier.
- *title:* the title displayed either in a selector or a button.
- *color:* the color used to display the button title.
- *icon:* the reaction icon.
- *alternativeIcon:* the optional alternative icon used with the reaction button.

The library already packages the standard Facebook reactions: `like`, `love`, `haha`, `wow`, `sad` and `angry`. And of course you can create your owns:

```swift
let myReaction = Reaction(id: "id", title: "title", color: .red, icon: UIImage(named: "name")!)
```

### ReactionSelector

 <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798235/19212442/8b9fe032-8d51-11e6-84c3-e2a026a31d72.png" alt="ReactionSelector" height="65px">

The `ReactionSelector` control allows people to select a reaction amongst a list:

```swift
let select       = ReactionSelector()
select.reactions = Reaction.facebook.all

// React to reaction change
select.addTarget(self, action: #selector(reactionDidChanged), for: .valueChanged)

func reactionDidChanged(_ sender: AnyObject) {
  print(select.selectedReaction)
}

// Conforming to the ReactionFeedbackDelegate
select.feedbackDelegate = self

func reactionFeedbackDidChanged(_ feedback: ReactionFeedback?) {
  // .slideFingerAcross, .releaseToCancel, .tapToSelectAReaction
}
```

The component can be used alone (like above) or in conjunction with the `ReactionButton` (discussed later). You can of course customize the component using a `ReactionSelectorConfig` object:

```swift
select.config = ReactionSelectorConfig {
  $0.spacing        = 6
  $0.iconSize       = 40
  $0.stickyReaction = false
}
```

### ReactionButton

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798235/19213727/b43341d4-8d73-11e6-9696-5f10dcf6815d.gif" alt="ReactionButton" height="32px">

A `ReactionButton` provides a simple way to toggle a reaction (e.g. like/unlike). A `ReactionSelector` can also be attached in order to display it when a long press is performed:

```swift
let button      = ReactionButton()
button.reaction = Reaction.facebook.like

// To attach a selector
button.reactionSelector = ReactionSelector()
```

You can configure the component using a `ReactionButtonConfig` object:

```swift
button.config         = ReactionButtonConfig() {
  $0.iconMarging      = 8
  $0.spacing          = 4
  $0.font             = UIFont(name: "HelveticaNeue", size: 14)
  $0.neutralTintColor = UIColor(red: 0.47, green: 0.47, blue: 0.47, alpha: 1)
  $0.alignment        = .left
}
```

### ReactionSummary

The `ReactionSummary` is a control which display a given reaction list as a set of unique icons superimposed. You can also link it to a text description.

```swift
let summary       = ReactionSummary()
summary.reactions = Reaction.facebook.all
summary.text      = "You, Chris Lattner, and 16 others"

// As is a control you can also react to the .touchUpInside event
select.addTarget(self, action: #selector(summaryDidTouched), for: .touchUpInside)
```

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798235/19440513/792e0b6c-9482-11e6-8410-c5522ca93fed.png" alt="ReactionSummary Non Aggregated" height="23px">

You can also have the details for each reaction. For that you'll need to uncombined them by setting the `isAggregated` config property to `false`.

```swift
summary.config = ReactionSummaryConfig {
  $0.isAggregated = false
}
```

Like the other components you can setting it using a `ReactionSummaryConfig` object:

```swift
summary.config = ReactionSummaryConfig {
  $0.spacing      = 8
  $0.iconMarging  = 2
  $0.font         = UIFont(name: "HelveticaNeue", size: 12)
  $0.textColor    = UIColor(red: 0.47, green: 0.47, blue: 0.47, alpha: 1)
  $0.alignment    = .left
  $0.isAggregated = true
}
```

## Installation

#### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your *Podfile* and add _Reactions_:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

use_frameworks!
pod 'Reactions', '~> 3.0.0'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file):

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

You can now `import Reactions` framework into your files.

#### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate `Reactions` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile` file:

```ogdl
github "yannickl/Reactions" >= 3.0.0
```

#### Swift Package Manager

You can use [The Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) to install `Reactions` by adding the proper description to your `Package.swift` file:
```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    targets: [],
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/yannickl/Reactions.git", versions: "3.0.0" ..< Version.max)
    ]
)
```

Note that the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) is still in early design and development, for more information checkout its [GitHub Page](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

#### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/YannickL/Reactions/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `Sources` and `Resources` folders into your project to use it in.
